```bash
cd my_practice
```

You're now inside the `my_practice` folder.

This creates an empty file called `notes.txt`.

---

### âœ… **Step 5: Create a Subdirectory**

```bash
mkdir projects
```

Creates a new folder named `projects` inside `my_practice`.

---

### âœ… **Step 6: Move the File into the Subdirectory**

```bash
mv notes.txt projects/
```

Moves `notes.txt` into the `projects` folder.

---

### âœ… **Step 7: Navigate to the Subdirectory**

```bash
cd projects
```

---

### âœ… **Step 8: Add Text to the File**

```bash
echo "This is my first Linux file." > notes.txt
```

Adds content to the file.

```bash
cat notes.txt
```

```

---

### âœ… **Step 12: Delete One File**
