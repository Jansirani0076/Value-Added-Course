After the download is complete, go to the downloaded folder, then click and start the installation.

#### Note

The installer for VirtualBox 7.0.10 will likely not proceed until it detects that the Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 Redistributable is installed.

To fix this, you need to:

**Download** : Get the redistributable package directly from the official Microsoft website. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170

**Install** : Run the installer.

**Rerun**: Start the VirtualBox installation again. It should now proceed without the error.

**Reboot**

 Complete the installation. If a restart is required, please reboot your computer before launching VirtualBox. This is necessary to finalize the installation of the new system drivers.

**Enable Virtualization**

The specific name for the virtualization option can vary depending on the motherboard manufacturer and CPU brand, but here are the most common names you'll find in the BIOS/UEFI settings:

* **For Intel CPUs:**
    * **Intel Virtualization Technology**
    * **Intel VT-x**
    * **Virtualization Technology (VTx)**

    * **SVM Mode** (Secure Virtual Machine Mode)
